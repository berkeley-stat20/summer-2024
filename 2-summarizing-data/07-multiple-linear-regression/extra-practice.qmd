Load the `penguins` dataset into R and answer the following questions. Where code is needed, you may write it down in the space given. 

### Question 1

Fit the multiple linear regression model from today's slides, but instead having `"Chinstrap"` as the reference level in the `species` variable. Interpret the coefficient corresponding to the `"Adelie"` indicator variable in the context of the problem.

\
\
\

### Question 2

Write out the mathematical equation of the line whose coefficients are given by your model output.

\
\
\

### Question 3

Now, consider the relationship between bill length and bill depth when broken down by species. *Sketch* (do not code) a plot which can be used to summarize the relationship between all three variables. *Depict a shape which reflects your expectation of the phenomenon*. State the aesthetic mappings and geometry involved in the plot. Finally, label your axes and give the plot a title.
