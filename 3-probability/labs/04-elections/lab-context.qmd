@. What is the unit of observation in the dataset shown in the screengrab?

\

@. Sketch a plot of the distribution of the vote counts for Ahmadinejad. Label your axes and title your plot with a claim about the shape and modality of the data. Depict a shape which reflects **your** expectation of the phenomenon.

@. Sketch a plot of the distribution of the *first digit* of the vote counts for Ahmadinejad. Label your axes and title your plot with a claim about the shape and modality of the data. Depict a shape which reflects **your** expectation of the phenomenon.

Let $X$ be a random variable which represents the first digit of vote tallies. 

@. If you had no inclination as to what the probability distribution of first digits of vote counts would look like, what distribution might you assign $X$? 

-   State a distribution (and the values which it can take). 

-   Write down the probability mass function of this distribution. 

\newpage


@. Sketch a probability histogram which describes the probability distribution of $X$. Label your axes. 

\

\

\

@. Then calculate $\mathbb{E}(X)$ and $Var(X)$ for a random variable $X$ having the distribution you assigned it in the previous question.

One common theory on how to determine whether an election is fair is as follows: 

> In a normally occurring, fair election, the *first digit* of the vote counts for each voting precinct should follow **Benfordâ€™s Law**. If they do not, that might suggest that vote counts have been manually altered.

Benford's Law is not any universal, binding statute but actually a probability distribution on the set $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$. Let $Y$ be a random variable following the Benford's Law probability distribution. Then:

$$
f(y) = log_{10}(1 + \frac{1}{y})
$$


@. Sketch an (approximate) probability histogram which describes the probability distribution of $Y$. Label your axes. 

\

\


\



@. Use the formula to calculate $\mathbb{E}(Y)$.

\

\


@. Use the formula to calculate $Var(Y)$.
