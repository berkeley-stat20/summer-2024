<!-- ## Case Study: Cherry Blossom Run -->

<!-- The Cherry Blossom Run is an annual 10-mile race that takes place in April in Washington D.C. when the cherry trees are in bloom. Data were scraped from the Run’s website and include official times and other information, such as the age, sex, and address for all registered runners from the 2019 race. Designed as a preparatory race for professional runners in the New York Marathon, roughly 10,000 people participate each year. An ambitious data scientist used these data to compare the times of 30-year-old runners to 50-year-old runners, to study how running speed changes as Americans go through middle age. -->

<!-- 1. Describe the sample. Roughly how large is it ($n$) and what is the unit of observation? -->

<!-- 2. Describe the population. How large is it ($N$)? -->

<!-- 3. Identify the population parameter that researchers are interested in estimating and the corresponding statistic that will serve as the estimate. -->

<!-- 4. Identify possible sources of bias and whether they are selection or measurement bias. How do you expect this will effect the estimate of the parameter? -->

<!-- 6. On a separate sheet of paper, make two sketches: an empirical distribution of the data and what you think the sampling distribution of the statistic might look like given what you know about the data collection. Be sure to label the axes of both plots. Illustrate any anticipation of bias you have by adding a vertical line on the sampling distribution that hits the x-axis where you expect the population parameter to be. -->

## Case Study 1: National Youth Tobacco Study

The National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) is a complex survey carried out by the CDC to better understand the rate of e-cigarette usage among teens. It is a school-based, pencil-and-paper questionnaire, self-administered to a nationally representative sample of students in grades 6-12 in the U.S. In 2019, 5,675 students completed the NYTS; the overall survey response rate was 71.6%. Among other questions, students were asked if they had used an e-cigarette in the past 30 days.

1. Describe the sample. How large is it ($n$) and what is the unit of observation?

\

2. Describe the population. Approximately how large is it ($N$)?

\

3. Select a population parameter that researchers would be interested in estimating and the corresponding statistic that will serve as the estimate.

\

4. Identify possible sources of statistical bias and whether they are selection, measurement, and non-response bias. How do you expect this will effect the estimate of the parameter?

On the back of this page make two sketches: 1. an empirical distribution of the data and 2. what you think the sampling distribution of the statistic might look like given what you know about the data collection. Be sure to label the axes of both plots. Illustrate any anticipation of bias you have by adding a vertical line on the sampling distribution that hits the x-axis where you expect the population parameter to be.

<!-- ## Case Study 2: World Health Organization -->

<!-- Substantial global progress has been made in reducing childhood mortality since 1990. The total number of under-5 deaths worldwide has declined from 12.6 million in 1990 to 5.0 million in 2020. Yet, two regions, Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, account for more than 80% of these under-five deaths, despite making up only 50% of the global population. These statistics are based on country data collected by the WHO. The WHO aims to use statistics from the 194 countries in the United Nations to associate child mortality with diseases such as infectious diseases, pre-term birth complications, and congenital anomalies. Each year the WHO collects a new data set and calculates new statistics. In the most recent year, the data came from 80 countries that provided birth registrations and data from their federal health departments. -->

<!-- ## Case Study 4: Baseball -->

<!-- Sean Lahman created and maintains the Lahman Baseball Database, an open-source collection of baseball statistics.  It contains data on individual baseball players and statistics on teams for every season, dating back to 1871.  It’s fun to explore all sorts of questions about baseball. For the purposes of this exercise, a data scientist is interested in the relationship between team payrolls and winning the World Series. -->
