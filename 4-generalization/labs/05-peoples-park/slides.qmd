:::notes
This is a recent new article in Berkeleyside, the local paper, about the incredible lengths to which the university has gone to ensure that it can proceed with the development of People's Park into housing.

If you're not familiar with the debate (which has lasted many years and is ongoing), search the archives at Daily Cal and Berkeleyside for background.
