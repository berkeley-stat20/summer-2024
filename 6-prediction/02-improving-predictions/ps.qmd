Today's data is on house pricing in Los Angeles! We have access to data on all of the houses that sold in four cities around west LA in the course of a single month. Our goal is to predict the price of a home based on a few attributes of that home. Check Ed for a link to the data.

*Where applicable, answer the following questions using R code and write the code you used in the space below*. 

@. Create a scatterplot examining the relationship between square footage and price. Write the code you used below. 

\

\

@. Add two columns onto the `LA` dataset which measure *log* price and *log* square footage. Save the new dataset back into itself. 

\

\

@. Create another scatterplot examining the relationship between *log* square footage and *log* price. Rather than writing the code you used, explain in at least two sentences whether the logged variables or the regular variables are more suitable for a linear model.

\

\

@. Fit two linear models

-   one which predicts price with square footage
-   one which predicts log price with log square footage

> Report the $R^2s$ for both models, and in a sentence, state whether the results you have line up with your explanation in the last question.

Recently the University of California purchased a new house to serve as the residence of the university President and to host university functions. The address of the house is 2821 Claremont Blvd in Berkeley. 

@. Use your linear model to predict the sale price in log USD of this house. (hint: the internet is helpful!). Then, find this price in regular USD. 

\



@. Was your model an under- or over-estimate? Why do you think this is?
