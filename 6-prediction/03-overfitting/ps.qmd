title: "Overfitting"
format: stat20handout-pdf
---


In this problem set you'll practice fitting and evaluating different predictive models to see if you can detect overfitting. You can load in the data via a link on Ed. For the following questions, fill in the space below with the R code you used.




@. Visualize the relationship between $x$ and $y$ with a `ggplot` and comment on what you see, describing the strength, direction, and shape/form of the association.


\

\

\




@. Split your data into training and testing sets; seventy percent of the data should be allocated to the training set.

\

\

\

@. Fill out the below table. You will fit a model with a polynomial having the degree specified, and report the testing and training $\text{RMSE}$ in each case. 
    
    | Degree | Training RMSE | Testing RMSE |
    |--------|---------------|--------------|
    | 1      |               |              |
    | 2      |               |              |
    | 3      |               |              |
    | 4      |               |              |
    | 5      |               |              |
    | 10     |               |              |
    | 20     |               |              |
    | 25     |               |              |
    
    To help you, here is some code that will calculate training     $\text{RMSE}$ for you, provided you have fit a linear model called     `m1` and make a training set called `train`:
    
    ```{r}
    #| echo: true
    #| eval: false
    train |>
      mutate(yhat = predict(object = m1, newdata = _____),
             resid = _______) |>
      summarise(MSE = mean(resid^2))
    ```
    
    You will need to modify this code slightly to help you find the testing RMSE. Write the modified code in the space below given a linear model `m1`.








@. Describe the pattern in the results you see and explain it.
