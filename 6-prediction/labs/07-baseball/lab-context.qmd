One source of data for this lab is the public `Lahman` database which contains a number of data sets with different units of observation. Below are the first few rows and some of the columns for two of these data sets: `Teams` and `Batting`. They contain data going back to 1871. Use these excerpts to help you answer the following questions.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
library(Lahman)
library(infer)
set.seed(5)
knitr::kable(head(Teams %>% 
                    slice_sample(n = 6, replace = FALSE) %>%
                    select(yearID, teamID, franchID, G, W, L, R, RA, name) %>%
                    arrange(desc(yearID))
                  ))

knitr::kable(head(Batting %>% 
                    slice_sample(n = 6, replace = FALSE) %>%
                    select(playerID, yearID, teamID, G, AB, R, H, BB, SO) %>%
                    arrange(desc(yearID))
                  ))
```

1. What is the unit of observation for the Teams data set? What about for the Batting data set?

\
\
\

2. Write out two questions about baseball that could answered purely through *summaries* of these data sets (numerical summaries or plots).


\
\
\
\
\

3. Write out *predictive* questions (two classification and two regression) that you could answer about baseball using the data sets above. Identify a response variable for each.

4. What is a question that we would need more granular (measured on a finer/more specific part of the game) data than the `Teams` and `Batting` data sets provide to answer?

5. Roughly since 1962 MLB Teams have played 162 games in a season. What do you think the distribution of wins (`W`) looks like? Sketch a plot of what you think the *entire* wins column looks like, adding axis tick marks with plausible values, and describe the shape in words.

6. What do you think the relationship between wins (`W`) and runs (`R`) looks like? Sketch a plot, adding axis tick marks with plausible values, and describe the shape in words.

7. Some people believe analytics is ruining baseball because Teams are more cautious which makes the games less entertaining. Do you agree or disagree? Why? Answer in two or more sentences.
