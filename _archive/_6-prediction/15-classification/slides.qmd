# Concept Questions

## Which of these are classification

```{r}
countdown::countdown(1, top = 0)
```

:::{.poll}
Which of these are classification tasks?
:::


## Bigger is always better?

```{r}
countdown::countdown(1, top = 0)
```

:::{.poll}
The larger K, the more accurate KNN is since more samples get to vote?
:::


## Perfect predictions

```{r}
countdown::countdown(1, top = 0)
```

:::{.poll}
Will KNN with K=1 always give perfect predictions on the training data? What about K=3?
:::


## Better predictions

```{r}
countdown::countdown(1, top = 0)
```

:::{.poll}
KNN with K=3 will always give better test set predictions that K=1
:::

## Overfitting

```{r}
countdown::countdown(1, top = 0)
```

:::{.poll}
KNN with K=1 is more likely to overfit than K=3.
