</section>
<section id="course-culture" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-culture">Course Culture</h3>
<p>Students taking Stat 20 come from a wide range of backgrounds. We hope to foster an inclusive and supportive learning environment based on curiosity rather than competition. All members of the course community—the instructor, students, tutors, and readers—are expected to treat each other with courtesy and respect.</p>
<p>You will be interacting with course staff and fellow students in several different environments: in class, over the discussion forum, and in office hours. Some of these will be in person, some of them will be online, but the same expectations hold: be kind, be respectful, be professional.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about classroom environment issues created by other students or course staff, please come talk to us about it.</p>
</section>
<section id="mode-of-instruction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mode-of-instruction">Mode of Instruction</h3>
<p>This course is mostly structured as a flipped class, meaning that you will first be encountering new concepts in statistics and data science <em>outside</em> of class. Class time is dedicated to expanding on the work you’ve done outside of class by working through questions solo, in groups, and as a class. On Mondays and during select lectures, we will revert to a more traditional lecturing style.</p>
<!--
The reason that this course is structured in this manner is that applied data science is a complex field that unites scientific thinking, computing, mathematics, and an understanding of the context of the data. We will be able to tackle more interesting and challenging questions if we make room during class time to work on them while we're all in the same place.
-->
<section id="before-class" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="before-class">Before class</h4>
<section id="mondays" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mondays">Mondays</h5>
<p>Finish up your lab or study for your quiz! You can read more about this below.</p>
<section id="wednesdaysthursdays" class="level6">
<h6 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wednesdaysthursdays">Wednesdays/Thursdays</h6>
<p>It is your responsibility to become familiar with the topics that appear in the course notes and to <em>work through the reading questions on Gradescope by 12 pm Wedenesday (for Weds class) and 12pm Thursday (for Thurs class).</em></p>
<p>You’re encouraged to experiment to find the method that works best for you: downloading the notes as a pdf and making notes on them, asking and answering questions over the class forum, etc.</p>

<p>The instructor will walk through the material in a regular lecture format using the iPad, mixing in practice questions so you can work on them in groups. Once we cover everything we need to, we will spend the remainder of time working through components of Problem Sets and Labs.</p>
<p>We will be conducting the whole of the probability unit in this format.</p>
</section>
<section id="wednesdaysthursdays-flipped-classroom" class="level6">
<h6 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wednesdaysthursdays-flipped-classroom">Wednesdays/Thursdays: flipped classroom</h6>
<p>Class time will be spent on a range of activities, but the most common will be answering concept questions (using Poll Everywhere) that check your understanding of the notes in the first half of class, and then working through components of your Problem Sets and Labs in the second half of class. We will not be walking through the material like on Mondays, so it’s imperative that you complete the reading and the reading questions before coming to class.</p>
<!--
#### During class on Monday

Monday is shorter (1 hr) class that alternates between:

  - Workshops: less-structured class dedicated to finishing up work on your assignments
  - Quizzes: see information on quizzes below.

<!--
#### Plenary lectures

Several times during the semester, the course will be hosting a special guest to give a lecture to all sections of Stat 20. These speakers are preeminent scientists and data scientists from academia or industry who will speak about how the ideas and tools from Stat 20 are used in and impact the real world. These plenary lectures will be held outside of class time in the evening and the schedule will be announced during the semester. 

As a part of the graded assignments for the class **you will be asked to attend three lectures outside the class and hand in a small written assignment about each**. These lecture could be the Stat 20 plenary lectures or they could be from another event; the only restriction is that they have to be related to data science.

<p>Asking for help does not send a signal that you are behind or need extra help. On the contrary, asking for help early and often tends to co-occur with success in the course. To this end, we have a few options available for you when this!</p>
<section id="instructor-oh" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="instructor-oh">Instructor OH</h4>
<p>The instructor will offer office hours twice a week. Instructors are happy to chat about the course material, statistics in general, careers in statistics, and whatever other statistics or data science topics are on your mind!</p>

<section id="group-tutoring" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="group-tutoring">Group tutoring</h4>
<p>Tutors will offer one group tutoring session each week. This is an opportunity to finish up any assignments that you’ve started in class or review any topics that are confusing for you. Group tutoring is a great place to go to meet other students and collaborate on assignments with tutors on hand to help you get unstuck.</p>

<section id="reading-questions" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reading-questions">Reading Questions</h4>
<p>Reading questions serve to check your understanding and engagement while going through the lecture notes prior to class. They will be due at <strong>12pm on Wednesdays and Thursdays</strong>, so before the lectures on those days. There will be a handful of questions per lecture note. These questions be a mix of multiple choice, short answer, and coding questions. You can find them directly on Gradescope.</p>
</section>
<section id="participation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="participation">Participation</h4>
<p>On Wednesdays and Thursdays, we will be using the service PollEverywhere to record your participation. You will receive full credit as long as you participate in the poll questions on a given day.</p>
</section>
<section id="problem-sets" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="problem-sets">Problem Sets</h4>
<p>During class, we will give you a second engagement with the day’s material in the form of a worksheet. These worksheets will run like traditional homework problems and drill the concepts in the reading notes. The primary purpose of the problem sets are meant to help prepare you for the quizzes and the final exam. They will generally be due on <em>Thursdays at 11:59pm</em>, so that solutions can be released on Saturday.</p>
<p>These problem sets are graded on what we call <em>earnest engagement</em>. You will not be graded on accuracy, but you will be expected to show effort on the assignment. You can either receive full credit or no credit. The best way to achieve full credit is to explain your work wherever possible and attempt a fair number of the problems.</p>
</section>
<section id="assessments" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="assessments">Assessments</h4>
<p>These are the primary assignments in the course. Depending on the topic at hand, you will have either a <strong>lab</strong> or a <strong>quiz</strong> which will be due/taken every Monday.</p>
<section id="labs" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="labs">Labs</h5>
<p>Labs are week-long assignments designed to apply the concepts from the lecture notes in the cause of doing an analysis of real data. This will involve both writing code and communicating your thoughts and findings in English. We’ll be working through some problems from the labs in class, but you may have to complete them on your own outside of class time. Some labs will be turned in individually; some will be turned in as groups.</p>
<p>Labs are to be submitted as PDF files. These PDFs will be generated by rendering Quarto Documents (.qmd files) to HTML and then exporting the HTML into a PDF. Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with the Quarto Document as we will teach you about it!</p>
</section>
<section id="quizzes" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quizzes">Quizzes</h5>
<p>Quizzes reinforce the most important concepts from the lecture notes and provide you the opportunity to work through misunderstandings of concepts with peers and the instructor. They also will prepare you for the final exam.</p>
<p>There is both an <em>individual</em> and <em>group</em> component to the quiz.</p>
<p>The <em>individual</em> component will last ~25 minutes. You are allowed one, A4, one-sided handwritten sheet of notes. The <em>group</em> component will take place immediately after the individual component has been completed and will last ~15 minutes. <em>Groups must be of size 2-3.</em> Your grade for a given quiz will be the average of your group and individual quiz scores. The group component is meant to and overwhelmingly does help students raise their grades; one way to take advantage of this component is to work with a group that you have worked and studied with in class.</p>
<p>The current quiz dates are <strong>Monday, June 24th, Monday, July 8th</strong> and <strong>Monday, July 15th.</strong></p>
<!--
The problem sets will be procured completely from these in-class worksheets and released in one or two week intervals.

#### Plenary Lecture Reviews

An important way to engage with new ideas and people at a University is to attend guest lectures. Stat 20 will host 3-5 such lectures over the course of semester and will also provide a list of guest lectures in other departments that focus on topics related to probability, statistics, and data science.

A plenary lecture review is a written assignment that details the background of the speaker, the question they address, the tools, data, and methods they use, and their key findings. You will be asked to submit three such lecture reviews over the course of the semester based on the lectures that you have chosen to attend. These lecture reviews will be due at the end of the semester.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-exam">Final Exam</h3>
<p>The final exam is cumulative (covers all course topics). The time, date, and location is <strong>Wednesday, August 7 from 8-11am in Evans 10</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="grading" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>Your final grade in the course will be computed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading Questions: 5%</li>
<li>Participation: 5%</li>
<li>Problem Sets: 20%</li>
<li>Assessments: 49%</li>
<li>Getting Started Lab: 1%</li>
<li>EC Assessment: 1%</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="accomodations-for-students-with-disabilities">Accomodations for students with disabilities</h4>
<p>Stat 20 is a course that is designed to allow all students to succeed. If you have letters of accommodations from the Disabled Students’ Program, please share them with your instructor as soon as possible, and we will work out the necessary arrangements.</p>
</section>
<section id="late-work" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="late-work">Late Work</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, with a class of this size, we are unable to keep track of and grade submissions of labs, reading questions, and problem sets that come in very late. If you narrowly miss the standard deadline, you will still be able to submit within an hour for a small penalty (5% reduction in score). If you don’t submit within an hour you can still submit for a larger penalty (30% reduction).</p>
</section>
<section id="drops" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="drops">Drops</h4>
<p>In order to provide more flexibility around emergencies that might arise for you throughout the semester (for example, missing a quiz due to COVID), we will apply for everyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>one emergency drop for quizzes<br>
</li>
<li>one emergency drop for labs</li>
<li>two emergency drops for problem sets</li>
<li>two emergency drops for participation</li>
<li>two emergency drops for reading questions</li>
</ul>
<p>This means, for example, that we will drop your lowest quiz score before computing your average score across all quizzes.</p>
<p>The calculator linked in an above section does not account for drops, so if you would like, you can readjust the cells in your own copy of the calculator to reflect your particular circumstance!</p>

</section>
<section id="collaboration-policy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="collaboration-policy">Collaboration policy</h3>
<p>You are encouraged to collaborate with your fellow students on problem sets and labs, but the work you turn in should reflect your own understanding and all of your collaborators must be cited. The individual component of quizzes, reading questions, and exams must reflect only your work.</p>
<p>Researchers don’t use one another’s research without permission; scholars and students always use proper citations in papers; professors may not circulate or publish student papers without the writer’s permission; and students may not circulate or post non-public materials (quizzes, exams, rubrics-any private class materials) from their class without the written permission of the instructor.</p>
<p>The general rule: you must not submit assignments that reflect the work of others unless they are a cited collaborator.</p>
<p>The following examples of collaboration <strong>are</strong> allowed and in fact encouraged!</p>
<ul>
<li>Discussing how to solve a problem with a classmate.</li>
<li>Showing your code to a classmate along with an error message or confusing output.</li>
<li>Posting snippets of your code to the discussion forum when seeking help.</li>
<li>Helping other students solve questions on the discussion with conceptual pointers or snippets of code that doesn’t whole hog give away the answer.</li>
<li>Googling the text of an error message.</li>
<li>Copying small snippets of code from answers on Stack Overflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following examples are <strong>not</strong> allowed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leaving a representation of your assignment (the text, a screenshot) where students (current and future) can access it. Examples of this include websites like course hero, on a group text chain, over discord/slack, or in a file passed on to future students.</li>
<li>Accessing and submitting solutions to assignments from other students distributed as above. This includes copying written answers from other students and slightly modifying the language to differentiate it.</li>
<li>Googling for complete problem solutions.</li>
<li>Working on the reading questions or individual quizzes in collaboration with other people or resources. These assignments must reflect individual work.</li>
<li>Submitting work on an quiz or final that reflects consultation with outside resources or other people. These assessments must reflect individual work.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about the boundaries of the policy, please ask. We’re always happy to clarify.</p>
<section id="violations-of-the-collaboration-policy" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="violations-of-the-collaboration-policy">Violations of the collaboration policy</h4>
<p>The integrity of our course depends on our ability to ensure that students do not violate the collaboration policy. We take this responsibility seriously and forward cases of academic misconduct to the Center for Student Conduct.</p>
<p>Students determined to have violated the academic misconduct policy by the Center for Student Conduct will receive a grade penalty in the course and a sanction from the university which is generally: (i) First violation: Non-Reportable Warning and educational intervention, (ii) Second violation: Suspension/Disciplinary Probation and educational interventions, (iii) Third violation: Dismissal.</p>
<p>And again, if you have questions about the boundaries of the collaboration policy, please ask!</p>

<section id="frequently-asked-questions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What should I do if I’m on the waitlist?</p>
<p>Attend <em>both</em> lecture and section (remember, we are teaching it as <em>one</em> two hour class), and submit all assignments on time. Visit your instructor on the first day of class so you can be added to the course Ed and Gradescope.</p></li>
<li><p>Are class sessions recorded?</p>
<p>No.&nbsp;Class sessions feature a mix of group problem solving, activities, and discussion and don’t lend themselves to recording. The course notes are the main reference source for the course. Any materials used during the class session will be posted to the course website.</p></li>
<li><p>Is attendance required?</p>
<p>No, but it is difficult to succeed in this course if you are not regularly attending class. Class sessions are designed to be an effective and efficient format to make progress on important assignments. Plus, it’s a great way to meet your fellow students and learn from one another.</p>
<p>If you can’t attend due to a religious observance, athletic competition, or something similarly important, don’t worry. Just reach out to us via a private Ed post, and we can let you know what to keep tabs on during the time you’re away.</p></li>
<li><p>Are time conflicts allowed?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Stat 20 does not allow students to enroll with time conflicts.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>What if I join the class late?</p>
<p>If you join the class within the first two weeks, read the syllabus and lecture notes, take a look at Gradescope to get a sense of any assignments that may have already passed, and visit office hours to check that you’re up to date with things. The first two weeks of material are very important so you must be able to make up some assignments.</p>
<p>After two weeks into the semester, you’ll have too much material that you’ll need to make up, so you will have to wait to a subsequent semester to take Stat 20.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dont-come-to-class-if-youre-sick">Don’t come to class if you’re sick!</h3>
<p>Maintaining your health and that of the Berkeley community is of primary importance to course staff, so if you are feeling ill or have been exposed to illness, whether it’s COVID-19 or something else, please do not come to class. All of the materials used in class will be posted to the course website.

<p>If you ever need someone to talk to about anything that you’re going through, please feel to reach out to the instructors. For some topics, the tutors might be an even better resource because they are students just like you. Tutors can also tell you what being an Academic Student Employee (ASE) is like.</p>
<p>With regards to reports of sexual misconduct/violence/assault, you may speak with us as well, but know that we will need to report our discussion to the Title IX officer. This is detailed below.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>As UC employees, the instructors (and tutors) are “Responsible Employees” and are therefore required to report incidents of sexual violence, sexual harassment, or other conduct prohibited by University policy to the Title IX officer. We cannot keep reports of sexual harassment or sexual violence confidential, but the Title IX officer will consider requests for confidentiality. Note that there are confidential resources available to you through UCB’s PATH to Care Center, which serves survivors of sexual violence and sexual harassment; call their 24/7 Care Line at 510-643-2005.</em></p>
